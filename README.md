# README #
This is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) application that represents a Chat Room.
At a high level, it will ingest a JSON object that represents
a chat log, and display it in a visual format.

### What is this repository for? ###
This repository was created as an interview project to asset candidates.

### Dependencies
- NodeJS - was built using version `14.17.3`. Would recommend using the same Major version

### Version
**0.0.1**

This project uses semantic versioning.

Since this is the 1st iteration of this application and the APIs
aren't flushed out, the Major version will remain at 0. 

For more info about semantic versioning, see the following documentation. https://semver.org/   

### Design Decisions
See my high-level design decisions [here](DesignDecisions.md).

### How do I get set up? ###

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm install`
Installs the dependencies found in `./package.json`

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

#### Deployment

This section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment)

### Contribution guidelines ###

#### Writing tests
The project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as the underlying test runner.
All `.js` files should have an accompanying `*.test.js` file.

### Who do I talk to? ###
The interviewer and me, (I guess ðŸ˜…)
